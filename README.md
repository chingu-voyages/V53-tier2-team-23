# Eato App

## Overview

This app was created for Chingu Voyage 53. It integrates with the [Dishes API](https://menus-api.vercel.app/dishes) to provide a menu scheduling platform, enabling managers to create and share weekly meal plans with staff. The application ensures employees have clear visibility of the planned meals while accounting for dietary restrictions and allergies.

- [ ] Allow multiple allergy inputs, with the option to save and manage them for future menu planning.
- [ ] Automatically filter out dishes containing allergens based on workers' allergy data items.

- Week Scheduling

  - [ ] Provide managers with the ability to schedule menus for a specific week using:
    - Date Picker: A calendar interface for seamless week selection.
    - Default Option: Automatically pre-select the upcoming week for scheduling.
    - Manual Input: Allow managers to specify the start and end dates of the week.
  - [ ] Define the weekly menu structure as a 7-day period starting on Monday and ending on Sunday.

- Dish Management

  - [ ] Dish Assignment
    - Enable managers to assign dishes for each day of the week
      - [ ] Automatically generate a menu with one unique dish for each day using dishes API.
      - [ ] Write a logic to randomly select and assign unique dish for each day of the week.
      - [ ] Implement a regenerate weekly menu feature.
    - "Day Off" Feature
      - [ ] Enable marking specific weekdays as "Day Off", where no dish is assigned.
